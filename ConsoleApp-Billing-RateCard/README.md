# ConsoleApp-Billing-RateCard
---------------------------
This is a simple console app that calls the Azure Billing RateCard REST API to retrieve the list of resources per Azure offer in a given subscription, along with the pricing details for each resource. The app first fetches an access token using credentials of the signed-in user, then gets the RateCard response and deserializes it and prints it to the console.  

Please note, the Usage APIs were in Preview at the time of this writing. Please refer to MSDN article [Azure Billing REST API Reference (Preview)] (https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/1ea5b323-54bb-423d-916f-190de96c6a3c) for details on the Billing RateCard API.

## How To Run This Sample

To run this sample you will need:

- Visual Studio 2013 or higher
- An Internet connection
- An Azure subscription (a free trial is sufficient)

You will also need to be comfortable with the following tasks:

- Using the Azure Management Portal (or working with your administrator) to do configuration work 
- Using Git and Github to bring the sample down to your location machine
- Using Visual Studio to edit configuration files, build, and run the sample

Every Azure subscription has an associated Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant.  If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can get a free subscription by signing up at [http://wwww.windowsazure.com](http://www.windowsazure.com).  

### Step 1: Configure a Native Client application in your AAD tenant
Before you can run the sample application, you will need to allow it to access your AAD tenant for authentication and authorization to access the Billing APIs.  If you already have a Native Client Application configured that you would like to use (and it is configured according to the steps below), you can jump to Step 2.

To configure a new AAD application:

1. Log in to the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), using credentials that have been granted service co-administrator access on the subscription which is trusting your AAD tenant, and granted Global Administrator access in the AAD tenant.
2. Select the AAD tenant you wish to use, and go to the "Applications" page.
3. From there, you can use the "Add" feature to "Add a new application my organization is developing".
4. Provide a name (ie: ConsoleApp-Billing-RateCard or similar) for the new application.
5. Be sure to select the "Native Client Application" type, then specify a valid URL for "Redirect URI" (which can be http://localhost/ for the purposes of this sample), and click the check mark to save.
6. After you've added the new application, select it again within the list of applications and click "Configure" so you can make sure the sample app will have permissions to access the Windows Azure Service Management APIs, which is the permission used to secure the Billing APIs.  
7. Scroll down to the to the "Permissions to other applications" section of your newly created application's configuration page.  Then click the "Add Application" button, select the "Windows Azure Service Management" row, and click the check mark to save.  After saving, hover the "Delegated Permissions" area on the right side of the "Windows Azure Service Management" row, click the "Delegated Permissions" drop down list, select the "Access Azure Service Management (preview)" option, and click "Save" again.

    **NOTE**: the "Windows Azure Active Directory" permission "Enable sign-on and read users' profiles" is enabled by default.  It allows users to sign in to the application with their organizational accounts, enabling the application to read the profiles of signed-in users, such as their email address and contact information.  This is a delegation permission, and gives the user the ability to consent before proceeding.  Please refer to [Adding, Updating, and Removing an Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn132599.aspx) for more depth on configuring an Azure AD tenant to enable an application to access your tenant.
  
8. While you are on this page, also note/copy the "Client ID" GUID and "Redirect URI", as you will use these in Step #3 below.  You will also need your Azure Subscription ID and AAD tenant domain name, both of which you can copy from the "Settings" page in the management portal.

### Step 2:  Clone or download the BillingCodeSamples repository

From your shell (ie: Git Bash, etc.) or command line, run the following command :

    git clone https://github.com/Azure/BillingCodeSamples.git

### Step 3:  Edit and Build the sample in Visual Studio
After you've configured your tenant and downloaded the sample app, you will need to go into the local sub directory in which the Visual Studio solution is stored (typically in <your-git-root-directory>\BillingCodeSamples), and open the ConsoleApp-Billing-RateCard.sln Visual Studio solution.  Upon opening, navigate to the app.config file and update the following key/value pairs, using your subscription and AAD specific configuration information from earlier.  NOTE: It's very important that all values match your configuration!

	<add key="ADALRedirectURL" value="https://localhost/"/>
	<add key="TenantDomain" value="ENTER.AZURE.AD.DNS.NAME"/>                           
	<add key="SubscriptionID" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"/>
	<add key="ClientId" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"/>

When you build the solution, it will also restore the missing Nuget packages which contain libraries upon which the sample depends.  Program.cs contains the RateCard query string, so if you would like to query for different data, you can also change the OfferDurableId, Currency, Locale, and/or RegionInfo parameter values.

### Step 4:  Run the application against your AAD tenant

When finished with Step 3, you should be able to successfully run the application, which will prompt you for your Azure AD credentials.  Upon successful authentication, the API will be called and the results will be displayed in the console window.  

**Note**: The Azure Billing REST APIs are implemented as a Resource Provider as part of the Azure Resource Manager, and therefore share its dependencies.  Access control for Azure Resource Manager uses the built-in Owner, Contributor, and Reader roles, via the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) feature in the [Azure Preview Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  Therefore, you must make sure that the logged-in user is a member of either the ‘Reader’, ‘Owner’ or ‘Contributor’ roles for the specified subscription.  By default, all service administrators are members of the Owner role. For details, see [Role-based access control in the Microsoft Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure/).
