# Microsoft Azure Billing API Code Samples

The Microsoft Azure Billing have moved to the new [Azure Code Sample](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/samples/) repositories. You can also navigate directly to the 3 new repositories:

-	[billing-dotnet-usage-api](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/billing-dotnet-usage-api) - This sample will help you get started with the Usage API.
-	[billing-dotnet-ratecard-api](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/billing-dotnet-ratecard-api/) - This sample help you get started with the RateCard API.
-	[billing-dotnet-webapp-multitenant](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/billing-dotnet-webapp-multitenant/) - This Multi-Tenant sample creates a WebApp that allows the signed-in user to give it consent, to call the Azure Graph API and the Usage API on the user's behalf. It also shows the OAuth flows required to get consent for the ‘Reader’ role, to access the list of Microsoft Azure subscriptions that the user wants to allow access to. 

To learn more about the Billing Usage and RateCard APIs, visit the overview article [Gain insights into your Microsoft Azure resource consumption](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/billing-usage-rate-card-overview/).  Please note, the Billing APIs were in Preview at the time of this writing. Please refer to MSDN article [Azure Billing REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt218998.aspx) for current details on the Billing APIs.
